My collection of Docker images.

---

Most of these images are based on top of Alpine Linux since I like the pratice of making images as small and lightweight as possible. These images are generally built for my own needs but they are available in the [public repository](https://hub.docker.com/u/jonjack/) in case anyone else finds them useful. 

### Alpinginx

Nginx HTTP server.

```bash
docker pull jonjack/alpinginx
```

### Alpinode

Node + NPM.

### Jalpine

Java running on Alpine.

This image provides tags for both the 64 bit Server JRE and the JDK versions depending on your needs.
